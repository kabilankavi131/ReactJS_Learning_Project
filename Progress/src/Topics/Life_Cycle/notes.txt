Lifecycle Methods in React Class :
        1. Mounting ===> constructor, static getDerivedStateFromProps, render and componentDidMount
        2. Updating ====> static getDerivedStateFromProps, shouldComponentUpdate, render, getSnapshotBefore Update and component Did Update
        3. Unmounting ===> component WillUnmount
        4. Error Handling ====> static getDerivedState From Error and component Did Catch

1. Mounting Lifecycle Methods. : 
    1.constructor ( props) : 
       *  A special function that will get called whenever a new component is created.
       * Initializing state
       * Binding the event handlers
       * Do not cause side effects. Ex: HTTP requests
       * super(props)
       * Directly overwrite this.state
    2. static getDerivedStateFromProps( props, state) :
        * Method is called every time a component is re-rendered
        * When the state of the component depends on changes in props over time.
        * Set the state
        * Do not cause side effects. Ex: HTTP requests
    3. render() :
        * Only required method
        * Read props & state and return JSX
        * Do not change state or interact with DOM or make ajax calls.
        * Children components lifecycle methods are also executed.
    4. component Did Mount() :
        * Invoked immediately after a component and all its children components have been rendered to the DOM.
        * Cause side effects. Ex: Interact with the DOM or perform any ajax calls to load data.

2. Updating Lifecycle Methods :
    1. static getDerivedStateFromProps( props, state) :
        * Method is called every time a component is re-rendered
        * Set the state
        * Do not cause side effects. Ex: HTTP requests
    2. shouldComponentUpdate( nextProps, nextState) :
        * Dictates if the component should re-render or not
        * Performance optimization
        * Do not cause side effects. Ex: HTTP requests Calling the setState method
    3. render() Method : 
        * Only required method
        * Read props & state and return JSX
        * Do not change state or interact with DOM or make ajax calls.
    4. componentDidUpdate(prevProps, prevState, snapshot) Method :
        * Called after the render is finished in the re-render cycles.
        * It indicates that all the components properly rendered after the update
        * It receive 3 parameteres which is prevProps, prevState, snapshot.
        * cause side effects.

    ====> Mostly used update function is render() and componentDidUpdate() methods !!
3. Unmounting Phase Method : 
    1. componentWillUnmount() : 
        * Method is invoked immediately before a component is unmounted and destroyed.
        * Cancelling any network requests, removing event handlers, cancelling any subscriptions and also nvalidating timers.
        * Do not call the setState method.
4. Error Handling Phase Methods :
    1. static getDerivedStateFromError(error) :
    2. component DidCatch(error, info)

    =====> When there is an error either during rendering, in a lifecycle method, or in the constructor of any child component.
